        <p> Modern architecture is an important part of living history. If looking at the overall picture This style of architecture is considered one of the three historical hierarchies of cities and communities throughout the country. together with traditional architecture and contemporary architecture When these buildings disappear A gap therefore arises. It's like a tooth falling out. This causes the richness and diversity of the urban community to decrease. Unfortunately, the ones that replaced them turned out to be newer buildings with monotonous designs.
            Modern architecture is based on proportion, materials, and purpose.

        <p>This is where I started documenting modern architecture ten years ago. Photography gives me a clear perspective and idea. Through learning the history of the building and the architect who designed it, until 2017, data collection became more urgent. When the Australian Embassy building in Thailand is about to be demolished The building was designed by Ken Woolley and completed in 1978.and became an outstanding example of modern architecture suited to the tropical climate. After the demolition of the building So I started publishing my photos through my website and Facebook page under the name Foto_ momo (full name: Fotograph of the Modern Movement).</p>
